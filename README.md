# Metaheuristics
[b]Overview[/b]
Here I share Python codes for hyperparameter optimization using metaheuristics, including Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Grey Wolf Optimization.
If any of the code benefits your research, please give a credit by citing Zhu et al. (2022):
Zhu, J. J., Borzooei, S., Sun, J., & Ren, Z. J. (2022). Deep Learning Optimization for soft sensing of hard-to-measure wastewater key variables. [i]ACS ES&T Engineering[/i], 2(7), 1341-1355.

[b]Trouble shooting[/b]
The sample codes were designed for 2 hidden layers multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). You can change the hyperparameter ranges based on your preferences.
If the code doesn't work for you, please check the following list:
•	The codes were created in 2019 and tested till 2022 in both Windows 7/10 and ubuntu 16.04, but it may not fit your Python environment or OS environment.
•	You may want to check the packages and their version if any compatible problem exist.
•	The sample codes skip some unnessary data processing steps, so check if any issues associated with data preprocessing.
•	The sample codes assume that you use parallel computing (i.e. multiple CPU cores). If you use single CPU core, please change the codes accordingly.
•	Check the above paper and its SI for more information.

Most of the codes were obtained or modified from other sources, additional credits to Hossam Faris and Jiachun Sun.
